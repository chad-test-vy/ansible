inventory.lst is your list of hosts

playbook.yml is the ansible playbook

template.j2 is the template for configuring the systemd-timesyncd service

Assuming you already have ansible installed, this playbook can be run with the command, "ansible-playbook -i inventory.lst playbook.yml" and does the following:
    • Removes the chronyd service if it's installed.
    • Removes the ntpd service if it's installed.
    • Installs the systemd-timesyncd service.
    • Configures the systemd-timesyncd via template.
    • Enables and starts the systemd-timesyncd service.
